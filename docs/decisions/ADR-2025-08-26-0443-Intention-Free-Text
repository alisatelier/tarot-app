# ADR YYYY-MM-DD: <Intention Free Text>

## Context

We are reintroducing the intention free-text input so that users can have a custom experience. We will integrate this into the LLM and have the current dropdown selections as 'In case you need inpiration'.

The 'Write Your Own Intention' should become no longer editable when another dropdown intention is selected, and if user selects 'Write Your Own Intention' again, the progress should be saved.

## Decision
Create a free-text input for intention that only appears when 'Write Your Own Intention' is selected from the drop down.

## Consequences
